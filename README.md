# Face Mask Detection

This project contains two versions of a face mask detection system.

## Version 1: Real-time Face Mask Detection using OpenCV

This version of the code utilizes the OpenCV library to perform real-time face mask detection using a webcam or video stream. It detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time video feeds.

### Features:
- Utilizes computer vision techniques for real-time face detection.
- Detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.
- Provides real-time feedback on the presence or absence of a face mask.

### Dependencies:
- Python 3
- OpenCV

### Usage:
1. Install Python 3 and OpenCV.
2. Run the script.
3. Ensure that your webcam is properly connected and positioned to capture faces.

## Version 2: Face Mask Detection on Images

This version of the code performs face mask detection on images provided to the model. It analyzes static images to determine whether a person in the image is wearing a face mask or not.

### Features:
- Processes static images to detect faces and determine if face masks are worn.
- Suitable for batch processing of images.

### Dependencies:
- Python 3
- Deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
- Trained face mask detection model

### Usage:
1. Install Python 3 and the required deep learning framework.
2. Download or train a face mask detection model.
3. Provide images to the script for analysis.

## Additional Notes:
- Both versions of the code can be further customized or extended based on specific requirements.
- Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and configured before running the scripts.
